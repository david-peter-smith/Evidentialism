Truth is a word with multiple meanings, and therefore has multiple contextual definitions

Explaining a temporal event
It is raining. 

Explaining a psychological state
I was telling the truth

Comparison to reality
Math is a symbolic representation of objects in reality.

Aesthetic Preference
Those lines are true.

etc.


----

Reality exists independent of or ability to accurately perceive it. Since reality exists things are objectively true or false. 

Radical skepticism is flawed since it relies on arguments which exist only because of the acceptance of observations and experiences. Functionally, not even people who bring up objects of radical skepticism adhere to and live as if these ideas are true, and therefore why would we even entertain such flawed notions as these that are not followed by their own advocates.
