# Evidentialism

## Epistemologically how do you know something to be true?

1. I Exist
    1. I can perceive my own consciousness of thought
    2. Reality Exists
        - Reality by definition is that what realy exists
        - Reality exists independent of our ability to accurately sense it
2. I experiance the world though my senses
    1. My senses are sometimes accurate
        - I have multiple senses which can corroborate or contradict each other
3. Evidence can be determined though my senses
    1. Observations about reality can be identified as facts
    2. Therories can be formed based on knowledge of facts and/or other theories.
    3. Evidence is a collection of Facts and Theroies
4. Evidence can be evaluated to measure it's alignment to reality.
    1. Evidence tested to be more closely aligned with reality is more accurately reveals the nature of reality
    2. That which can not be proven to conform to alignment with reality can not be known to be true
    3. Reality has the key attribute of consistincy which makes it predictable
5. Theories with greater predictive capability of reality supersede other Theories
    1. Predictive Capability implies it is more valid, consistant, accurate, and relative.
        - More materially Probative Evidence
