On Free Will

While causation is proven at a basic level to be true it does not provide a complete view of reality. It does show how matter comes into a pattern of objects, but does not explain how new causal chains can originate, ie. agents. While the causal chain explains the cause of the agent coming into being, it does not outline the new causal chains originating from that agent.

Having a causal chain for origination of agents is deterministic and the rules that limit the possibility of that agent acting within reality are deterministic as well. Choices that are made that originate by the agent, but yey are limited by the laws of nature are called free will.
